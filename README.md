# Imprint

Imprint is a local-first, provenance-preserving memory of the judgments you
express while working with Claude Code. It stores the raw **Case**, **Verdict**,
**Call**, optional **Reason**, and available chosen/rejected alternatives before
any principle is derived. Later projections never replace that source evidence.

Imprint 3.1.1 is the authority, ontology, resilience, and public-operability
release built on the clean 3.0.0 architectural reset and 3.0.1 integrity
closure. The v3 line is not data-compatible by accident: imports are
quarantined, migrations are additive, and JSON-LD is the portable interchange
format.

## What ships

- An immutable per-node capture spool and single-writer SQLite compiler.
- Bitemporal, append-only ontology records with node and edge provenance.
- A versioned typed ontology for judgment, self-model, chosen direction,
  business reality, consent, confidence, calibration, and outcomes.
- Bounded, deterministic retrieval with configurable domain selection.
- A separate ingestion floor for operator-reviewed external material.
- Markdown and lossless JSON-LD projections.
- Claude Code hooks for session retrieval, domain selection, explicit feedback
  capture, and content-free health reporting.
- Portable installers, uninstallers, tests, checksums, and CI for macOS, Linux,
  and genuine Windows runners.

Core operation is offline and has no telemetry. The former digest and profile-
learning flags were removed because no runtime implemented them. Passive
Screenpipe observation is roadmap-only and is not included or claimed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer, including Python 3.14, with `venv` and `pip`.
- Claude Code only if you want automatic hook integration. The CLI and store can
  be used without Claude Code.
- A local, non-cloud-synchronized data directory. Network drives and shared
  writable SQLite databases are unsupported.

## Install from a release artifact

Download and verify either release archive and `SHA256SUMS`. Extract the archive,
then run the installer inside it. Paths containing spaces are supported.

macOS or Linux:

```bash
bash install/install.sh
```

Windows PowerShell 7:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
& .\install\install.ps1
```

Both installers create an isolated virtual environment, write a portable config,
install an owned `imprint` launcher in the user's command path, register each
managed hook exactly once, and fail if the installed CLI cannot report version
`3.1.1`. Re-running the installer is safe and removes duplicate managed hooks
while preserving unrelated hooks. On POSIX, the installer adds one marked PATH
block to the active shell's login profile (`.zprofile`, `.bash_profile`, or
`.profile`); uninstall removes that exact owned block and leaves unrelated shell
configuration untouched. Windows uses the per-user `WindowsApps` directory,
which is already present in a normal PowerShell user PATH.

Advanced non-interactive options:

```bash
sh install/install.sh \
  --install-root "$HOME/Applications/Imprint App" \
  --data-root "$HOME/Imprint Data" \
  --launcher-dir "$HOME/.local/bin" \
  --operator primary
```

```powershell
& .\install\install.ps1 `
  -InstallRoot "$HOME\Applications\Imprint App" `
  -DataRoot "$HOME\Imprint Data" `
  -LauncherDir "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\WindowsApps" `
  -Operator primary
```

The configuration and environment-variable reference is in
[`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).

## Verify the installation

The installer creates a small owned launcher named `imprint` (or `imprint.cmd`)
and points it at the executable inside the isolated environment:

- macOS/Linux: `~/.local/lib/imprint-local/venv/bin/imprint`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ImprintApp\app\venv\Scripts\imprint.exe`

```bash
imprint version
imprint health
imprint health --deep
imprint whoami
imprint log --date 2026-07-16 --limit 100    # --date is a UTC calendar date
imprint export --format jsonld --output imprint-export.jsonld
```

The default health check is bounded and reports expensive facts as
`not_checked`; `--deep` explicitly runs SQLite integrity, permissions, receipt,
and backup verification. A fresh store reports `backup_state=never_created`
without becoming degraded. Health output contains counts and state, never
captured content.

`whoami` prints the opaque configured operator identity. Curation commands
default `--by` to the `whoami` identity; an explicit `--by` remains available for
another governed actor.

### `log` dates are UTC, not local

`log` lists at most 200 content-free canonical event-index rows for one **UTC**
calendar day and can filter by event type or opaque event ID. West of UTC, an
evening event has already crossed into the next UTC day, so querying your local
date returns zero rows for work that was captured correctly. Zero rows is not
evidence of a capture failure until you have checked the UTC date.

Omitting `--date` is always correct: it defaults to today in UTC. To name the
day explicitly:

```bash
imprint log --date "$(date -u +%F)" --limit 100
```

```powershell
imprint log --date ([DateTime]::UtcNow.ToString('yyyy-MM-dd')) --limit 100
```

### Reading `compiler_state`

`compiler_state` reports the **exclusive compiler lock**, not a process:

- `absent` (`compiler_state_label: idle`) — no compile operation holds the lock
  right now. This is the normal state between compiles.
- `held` (`compiling`) — a compile operation currently holds the lock.
- `invalid` (`invalid`) — the lock exists but its owner record is unusable.
  Health degrades with `compiler_lock_invalid`.

Compilation is one-shot and runs inside `imprint compile --once`, the Stop hook,
and the other commands that consume the spool. **Imprint installs no resident
compiler service, daemon, or scheduled task**, so there is no background process
to look for, restart, or find missing. `compiler_evidence` names what was
actually inspected: the configured compiler authority plus that lock.

```

`capture` queues an immutable event; only the configured compiler writes canon.
On a compiler-authorized installation, the Stop hook compiles its durable spool
before returning, so the captured correction is available to the next session
without a manual command. A non-compiler node remains spool-only. Claude's native
session identifier is mapped through an installation-local secret to a stable
opaque Imprint session URN; the native identifier is never written to the spool,
store, export, or retrieval receipt. Huge transcripts retain the last operator
feedback and bounded context, plus a content hash, byte counts, truncation flags,
and a visible degradation receipt rather than ingesting the entire transcript.
Imported material is quarantined until `keep` or `kill`. Review and deletion are
explicit operator actions. Run `--help` on any command for its closed arguments.
`supersede` is directional: the first node is the replacement and the second is
the prior head that leaves current retrieval. Both versions remain in history.
Proposal derivation creates reviewable candidates only; it never grants authority.
Typed ontology inputs use ontology schema `3.1.0`; they fail closed on unknown
fields, invalid authority, cross-operator relationships, and missing evidence.
Transcript, Screenpipe, financial, behavioral, and connector observations also
require a current source-specific `ConsentGrant`.

### Human approval for authority-changing commands

First trust must be enrolled from a native terminal. Imprint never accepts a
redirected secret ceremony:

```bash
imprint authority enroll
```

An authority-changing writer is deliberately a two-call operation. Run the
real command without a token first. It exits nonzero with
`E_AUTH_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` and an exact, persisted `approval_request`; no
semantic mutation or nonce consumption has occurred. Save only that embedded
JSON object as `approval-request.json`, inspect its purpose, transition,
subjects, sources, targets, result version IDs, scope, field paths, and digests,
then approve it at the native terminal:

```bash
imprint authority approve --input approval-request.json > approval-token.json
```

Retry the identical writer command with the returned token file:

```bash
imprint domain select research --by OPERATOR_ID \
  --approval-token approval-token.json
```

The token is short-lived and binds the exact command intent, prior state,
frozen execution fields, resulting record/version IDs, installation, ledger
head, operator, and one-time nonce. Changing the command arguments or prepared
state, replaying the token, or allowing it to expire fails closed. There is no
standalone `authority propose` command: the first call to the actual writer is
the only supported way to create an executable approval request.

## Uninstall safely

macOS or Linux:

```bash
bash install/uninstall.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
& .\install\uninstall.ps1
```

Uninstall removes the application, only hooks carrying Imprint's ownership
marker, and only a launcher carrying Imprint's marker and expected installed
target. A missing, replaced, or modified launcher is left untouched. It preserves
the data root and, by default, the config. `--purge-config`
or `-PurgeConfig` removes config too; neither option deletes captured data.
Canonical deletion requires explicit scope preview and confirmation and is documented in
[`docs/privacy-and-recovery.md`](docs/privacy-and-recovery.md).

## Safety model

- Raw operator evidence is stored before optional model work.
- A missing reason stays `null`; Imprint never invents a WHY.
- Inferred patterns are not eligible authority until explicitly ratified.
- Imported knowledge remains in a lower-trust floor with source receipts.
- Only the configured compiler node mutates canonical state.
- Retrieval has a deterministic byte budget (32 KiB by default).
- Failures, rejects, quarantine events, and degraded modes remain visible.

Installed hook bridges bound every child process to 10 seconds. Stop capture is
fail-closed on invalid input, timeout, a missing executable, corrupt config, or
child failure because it must not claim uncaptured feedback. Session retrieval,
domain injection, and content-free health are fail-open: they return empty
context plus a visible `degraded` receipt so Claude Code can start without
mistaking the failed read for a successful one.

Read [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md),
[`docs/ontology-contracts.md`](docs/ontology-contracts.md),
[`docs/privacy-and-recovery.md`](docs/privacy-and-recovery.md), and
[`docs/limitations-and-roadmap.md`](docs/limitations-and-roadmap.md) before using
Imprint with sensitive or regulated information.

Typed consent, observation, and outcome writes use dedicated fail-closed
commands documented in [`docs/ontology-contracts.md`](docs/ontology-contracts.md).

## Development and release verification

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[dev,release]'
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
.venv/bin/python tools/release/package.py
```

Artifact acceptance runs from extracted archives, not the checkout. CI includes
`windows-latest`; PowerShell parsing on macOS is not treated as Windows proof.

## License and security
